# NIJ Recidivism Data Analysis

This project is designed to analyze and predict recidivism using the **NIJ Recidivism Challenge Dataset**. The notebook includes data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, feature engineering, and training machine learning models.

## Dataset

We use **NIJ's Recidivism Challenge Full Dataset**: https://data.ojp.usdoj.gov/Courts/NIJ-s-Recidivism-Challenge-Full-Dataset/ynf5-u8nk/about_data)

This dataset contains demographics, criminal history, career history, and recidivism outcomes.

## Steps

Step 1: Load Dataset and libraries

Step 2: Address Missing Values

Step 3: Analyze Class Distribution

Step 4: Identify and Remove Irrelevant Features

Step 5: Encode Categorical Variables

Step 6: Build and Evaluate Baseline Logistic Regression Model

Step 7: Feature Engineering

Step 8: Fix Class Imbalance (SMOTE)

Step 9: Grid Search

Step 10: Loop through Model Iterations

Step 11: Build XGBoost

Step 12: Evaluate Model and Produce Results
